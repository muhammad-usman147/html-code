             <figcaption>The Lernaean <strong>Hydra</strong> was a dragon-like water serpent with fatally venomous breath, blood and fangs, a
                  daughter of Typhon and Echidna. The creature was said to have anywhere between five and 100 heads, although
                   most sources put the number somewhere between seven and nine. For each head cut off, one or two more grew 
                   back in its place. It had an immortal head which would remain alive after it was cut off. Some accounts
                    claim that the immortal head was made of gold. It lived in a swamp near Lerna and frequently terrorized
                     the townsfolk until it was slain by Heracles, who cut the heads off, with the help of his nephew Iolaus,
                      who then singed the oozing stump with a blazing firebrand to prevent any new heads from growing, as the
                       second of his Twelve Labors. Hera sent a giant crab to distract Heracles, but he simply crushed it under
                        his foot. Hera then placed it in the heavens as the constellation Cancer. After slaying the serpent, 
                        Heracles buried the immortal head under a rock and dipped his arrows in the creature's blood to make 
                        them fatal to his enemies. In one version, the poisoned arrows would eventually prove to be the undoing 
                 of his centaur tutor Chiron, who was placed in the heavens as the constellation Centaurus.
