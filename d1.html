                    <strong>Eastern</strong> dragons, also known as East Asian dragons,
                     are legendary creatures in  <strong>Eastern</strong> mythology,  <strong>Eastern</strong>
                      folklore, and East Asian culture at large.  <strong>Eastern</strong> 
                      dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles
                       and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake
                       -like with four legs. They traditionally symbolize]
                        potent and auspicious powers, particularly control
                         over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength,
                          and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture. During the days of Imperial 
                          China, the Emperor of China usually 
                    used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength
