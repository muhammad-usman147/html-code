             <figcaption>In both the modern period and ancient period, the <strong>Western</strong> dragon is typically depicted as a large, 
                 fire-breathing, scaly, horned, lizard-like creature; the creature also has leathery, bat-like wings, four legs,
                  and a long, muscular prehensile tail. 
                 Some depictions show dragons with feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, ivory spikes running down
                  its spine, and various exotic decorations.

                    In folktales, dragon's blood often contains unique powers, keeping them alive for longer or giving 
                    them poisonous or acidic properties. The typical Christian dragon protects a cavern or castle filled with
                     gold and treasure. An evil dragon is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it, and a good
                      one is said to give support or wise advice.
